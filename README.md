# NFT Reserve Auctions

Reserve auctions have seen significant traction as a mechanism for selling NFTs, but they have typically been limited to proprietary marketplaces. MintFund's mission is to expand opportunity for artists hoping to break out into the crypto art scene. Part of that mission is providing open access to best-in-class tools that artists need to thrive. MindFund hosted a crowdfunding campaign with Mirror to fund the development of a permissionless auction method.

We believe that building the tools for creatives to push their best works unfettered by cost, access, and exposure yields the next generation of mind bending work and an ever growing community of shared talent, spirit, and wealth. MintFund is dedicated to giving all communities, with emphasis to BIPOC & LGBTQIA folks, the means to take cryptomedia / NFTs by storm and move culture along with them. We recognize that the key to achieving our goal of launching life-changing creative careers on the blockchain is threefold:

> Cover gas fees to enable access to the tools to participate in the NFT ecosystem
> 
> Create tools for artists to increase their exposure and connect with collectors
> 
> Build a success-based funding source to ensure MintFund can continue to sustain its work without relying on donations
